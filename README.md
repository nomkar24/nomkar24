# Hi, I'm Omkar

BTech student focused on Embedded Systems and Electronics.

## About
I work on microcontrollers, PCB design, and low-level firmware development.  
Interested in bootloaders, OTA systems, and real-time applications.

## Tech Stack
- C
- Python
- STM32
- ESP32 (ESP-IDF)
- FreeRTOS
- Zephyr
- KiCad
- 
## Projects

### Custom STM32 Bootloader
Designed and implemented a custom bootloader with dual firmware slots and OTA update capability.  
Includes UART-based flashing, firmware validation, and rollback support.

### ESP32 MIDI Controller (BLE + USB)
Built a 24-key velocity-sensitive MIDI controller using ESP32-S3.  
Implements matrix scanning, interrupt-based timing for velocity detection, and supports both BLE MIDI and USB MIDI.

### Custom PCB Designs
Designed and fabricated multiple embedded PCBs including signal conditioning circuits, power regulation stages, and microcontroller-based control boards.  
Worked with buck converters, linear regulators, and analog filtering circuits.

## Currently Learning
- Advanced bootloader architecture
- RTOS internals
- System-level firmware design
